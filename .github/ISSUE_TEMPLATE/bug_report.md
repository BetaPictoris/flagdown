```
Only submit a bug report if you are sure that the issue is with Flagdown, and not with your configuration. If not you can use the discussions to ask for help:
https://github.com/BetaPictoris/flagdown/discussions

How to submit a bug: 
 - Describe the issue
 - Leave information on what device you are running Flagdown on
 - Use a Gist (https://gist.github.com) to paste your logs (Flagdown's output) and your `config.ini` file. 
 - Be patient and kind, it can take a good amount of time for your report to be noticed.
